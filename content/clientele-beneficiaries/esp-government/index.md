    description: |
      Governance, whether at the local body level, state level, or central level, periodically requires alignment on various policies and programs. Preparing for a higher degree of deliverables requires preparedness, awareness, motivation, and zeal to ensure government programs and projects reach the common man. 

      ESPeople's Government learning solutions team works hand-in-hand with the government to train the entire machinery for reaching the people beneficiaries.
